    "**Q1**. Describe the differences between text and binary files in a single paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Each line of text is terminated with a special character, which is the new line character (Ã¢Â€Â˜\\nÃ¢Â€Â™).\n",
    "\n",
    "While binary files are where there is no termination of line and data is stored only after the files are converted in binary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2**. What are some scenarios where using text files will be the better option? When would you like to use binary files instead of text files?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Text files are usually preferred as there is minor chances of data getting corrupted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary files are used when the data includes (audio, video and text) in a single file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3**. What are some of the issues with using binary operations to read and write a Python integer directly to disc?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:-\n",
    "\n",
    "When we read or write a python integer using binary operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary operations deal with raw data. One needs to identify how many bytes one would read or write.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4**. Describe a benefit of using the with keyword instead of explicitly opening a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:-\n",
    "\n",
    "When a file is opened using the with keyword, if some exceptions occur after opening a file, or at the end of the file it automatically does the closing of the file. There by not leaving an file in open mode and there would no need to explicitly close a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5**. Does Python have the trailing newline while reading a line of text? Does Python append a newline when you write a line of text?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, Python have the trailing newline while reading a line of text. When we write a newline has to be provided in python excpicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6**. What file operations enableÃ‚Â for random-access operation?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:-\n",
    "\n",
    "The file operations enable for random-access operation are seek() and tell().\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q7**. When do you think you'll use the struct package the most?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:-\n",
    "\n",
    "The struct package is mostly used while converting a common python types into C language types.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q8**. When is pickling the best option?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Pickling is best option for creating a new binary file using python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q9**. When will it be best to use the shelve package?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Shelve package is used to pickle data but treats the entire file as dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q10**. What is a special restriction when using the shelve package, as opposed to using other data dictionaries?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Only string data type can be used as key in this special dictionary object, whereas any picklable Python object can be used as value."
